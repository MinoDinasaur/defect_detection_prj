# Defect Detection Project

Welcome to the **Defect Detection Project** repository! This project is focused on leveraging advanced techniques to detect defects in materials, products, or processes using machine learning and computer vision.

## Overview

The Defect Detection Project aims to create a system that identifies and categorizes defects automatically. By utilizing cutting-edge algorithms, we hope to increase efficiency, reduce waste, and enhance quality assurance.

## Features

- **Automated Defect Detection**: Identify defects with high accuracy using machine learning models.
- **Image Processing**: Apply computer vision techniques for analyzing images.
- **Customizable Algorithms**: Adjust detection thresholds and parameters as per requirements.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluate accuracy and reliability of defect detection.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MinoDinasaur/defect_detection_prj.git
   cd defect_detection_prj
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the setup script (if applicable):
   ```bash
   python setup.py install
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset and ensure it's in the correct format.
2. Train the defect detection model:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py --data_path path/to/your/dataset
   ```
3. Use the trained model for defect detection:
   ```bash
   python detect_defects.py --image_path path/to/your/image
   ```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: TensorFlow, OpenCV, NumPy, and other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
